    <h1>Technical Report</h1>

      <h2>HTML CODE</h2>
      <a href="HTML02.txt" target="_blank"
        >HTML for Clock and Technical Report Page</a

      <h2>PASSWORD PROTECTION</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Same password protection from previous lab.</em><br /><br />
        The password protect method I used was encryption. Using
        <a href="https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/"
          >PageCrypt - Password Protect HTML</a
        >
        I was able to upload my HTML file and create a password. After clicking
        the submit button, a copy of my HTML file is downloaded onto my computer
        with new code. The new code is JavaScript. It uses the
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/">CryptoJSlibrary</a>
        where strong encryption is implemented and cannot be bypassed.

      <h2>ELEMENT CSS CLASS</h2>
      <p>
        The element CSS class I used is <b>tableHeaders</b>. I used it to change
        the background of only the headings of the table as well as add some
        padding.
      </p>

      <h2>GLOBAL CSS CLASS</h2>
      <p>
        The gloabl CSS class I used is <b>title</b>. I used it change the font
        weight and text decoration of all the titles in the table.
      </p>

      <h2>HTML5-ONLY FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        The two HTML5 only features used were <b>nav</b> and <b>footer</b>. The
        <b>nav</b> tag is used to define a set of navigation links. The contents
        of the <b>nav</b> tag included a tags which are links to other pages. In
        other words, the a tags are designations for the navigation bar. In
        regards to the content in the footer, I placed my name and student id.
        Two important pieces of information.
      </p>

      <h2>CSS3-ONLY FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        The two CSS3-Only features I included in my css file are
        <b>box-shadow</b> and <b>border-radius</b>. The box-shadow property
        attaches shadows to the element. I used this property alongside hover to
        make it clear to the user which row or picture they are looking at. To
        smooth the edges of the table and photos, I used the
        <b>border-radius</b> property to give them more of a round look.
      </p>
      <h2>TIME SPENT</h2>
      <p>
        Approximately five hours was taken to complete the lab. The tasks that
        took the most time were choosing the color scheme of the page and
        completing the technical report.
